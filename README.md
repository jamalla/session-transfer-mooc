# Session-Based Transfer Learning for MOOC Recommendation

This project explores transfer learning for session-based recommendation:
- Pretrain a session-based recommender on large public datasets (e.g., YOOCHOOSE, Amazon Books).
- Fine-tune and evaluate on the MARS MOOC dataset.
- Target use case: cold-start and data-scarce MOOC platforms.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
